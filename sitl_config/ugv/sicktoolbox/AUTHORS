The Sick LIDAR Matlab/C++ Toolbox
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sick LIDAR Matlab/C++ Toolbox was originally developed
and is currently maintained by Jason Derenick and Thomas Miller
at Lehigh University. It is branched from the source code used
by the Ben Franklin Racing Team, whose robot car, "Little Ben",
was only one of six to successfully finish the 2007 DARPA Urban
Grand Challenge.
